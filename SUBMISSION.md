## 🎯 Project Summary

Dark Prediction Market is a **fully privacy-preserving prediction market** built on Solana, leveraging Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. Unlike traditional prediction markets where all bets are public, our solution keeps bet amounts and predictions **encrypted** until market resolution, preventing front-running and market manipulation.

### The Problem

Traditional on-chain prediction markets suffer from:
- **Front-running**: Large bets are visible and can be front-run
- **Market manipulation**: Whales can influence outcomes by showing their positions
- **Privacy leaks**: Anyone can track your trading positions and strategies
- **Information asymmetry**: Public orderbooks create unfair advantages

### Our Solution

Using Arcium's encrypted compute:
- ✅ **Hidden bet amounts** - Bet sizes remain encrypted
- ✅ **Private predictions** - Your position stays secret  
- ✅ **Fair resolution** - MPC calculates winners without revealing individual bets
- ✅ **Trustless computation** - Decentralized Arx nodes process encrypted data
- ✅ **Transparent outcomes** - Results are publicly verifiable

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

```
Client (TypeScript) → Solana Program → Arcium MPC Network → Callback → On-chain Storage
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓                ↓              ↓
  Encrypt           Queue Computation    Process Encrypted    Return Result   Store State
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Encrypted Instructions (`encrypted-ixs/`)

Written in **Arcis** (Arcium's Rust framework):

- `place_bet.rs` - Encrypts and processes bet placements
- `resolve_market.rs` - Calculates payouts on encrypted data
- `generate_randomness.rs` - MPC-based fair randomness

```rust
#[encrypted]
mod circuits {
    #[instruction]
    pub fn place_encrypted_bet(
        input_ctxt: Enc<Shared, BetInput>
    ) -> Enc<Shared, BetReceipt> {
        // Operations on encrypted data
        let input = input_ctxt.to_arcis();
        let bet_id = input.market_id * 1000000u64 + input.user_nonce;
        
        let receipt = BetReceipt {
            bet_id,
            encrypted_amount: input.bet_amount,
            encrypted_prediction: input.prediction,
            timestamp: 0u64,
        };
        
        input_ctxt.owner.from_arcis(receipt)
    }
}
```

#### 2. Solana Program (`programs/dark-prediction-market/`)

Anchor-based program with Arcium integration:

- **State Management**: Markets, Bets, Resolutions
- **Computation Queueing**: Submits jobs to Arcium network
- **Callback Handling**: Processes MPC results
- **Access Control**: Creator-only resolution, bettor-only claims

```rust
pub fn place_bet(
    ctx: Context<PlaceBet>,
    computation_offset: u64,
    ciphertext_bet_amount: [u8; 32],
    ciphertext_prediction: [u8; 32],
    pub_key: [u8; 32],
    nonce: u128,
) -> Result<()> {
    // Queue encrypted computation
    queue_computation(
        ctx.accounts,
        computation_offset,
        args,
        None,
        vec![PlaceBetCallback::callback_ix(&[])],
    )?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 3. Client Library (`app/`)

TypeScript encryption and market interaction:

- **ArciumClient**: Handles x25519 key exchange and RescueCipher encryption
- **Market Management**: Create, bet, resolve, claim operations
- **Demo Application**: Full workflow demonstration

```typescript
// Encrypt bet data
const encrypted = await arciumClient.encryptBet({
    marketId: BigInt(1),
    betAmount: BigInt(5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
    prediction: 1, // YES
    userNonce: BigInt(Date.now())
});

// Submit to blockchain
await program.methods.placeBet(
    computationOffset,
    Array.from(encrypted.ciphertext_bet_amount),
    Array.from(encrypted.ciphertext_prediction),
    Array.from(encrypted.pub_key),
    encrypted.nonce
).rpc();
```

## 🔐 Privacy Features

### Encryption Flow

1. **Client generates ephemeral x25519 keypair**
2. **Derives shared secret with MXE public key**
3. **Encrypts data using RescueCipher**
4. **Submits ciphertext + public key to Solana**
5. **Arcium MPC network processes without decryption**
6. **Results returned encrypted or revealed**

### What Stays Private

| Data Type | Privacy Level |
|-----------|--------------|
| Bet Amount | 🔒 Encrypted until resolution |
| Prediction (YES/NO) | 🔒 Encrypted until resolution |
| Intermediate Calculations | 🔒 Never exposed |
| Individual Payouts | 🔒 Computed in MPC |

### What's Public

| Data Type | Visibility |
|-----------|-----------|
| Market Question | 🔓 Always public |
| Market Creator | 🔓 Always public |
| Total Bet Count | 🔓 Always public |
| Final Outcome | 🔓 After resolution |
| Aggregate Pools | 🔓 After resolution |

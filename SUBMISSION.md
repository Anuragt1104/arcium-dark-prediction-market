# üèÜ Hackathon Submission: Dark Prediction Market

**Team:** Alenka Media  
**Track:** Arcium + Colosseum Cypherpunk Hackathon  
**Submission Date:** October 11, 2025

---

## üìã Executive Summary

**Dark Prediction Market** is a privacy-preserving prediction market platform built on Solana that leverages Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network to keep bet amounts and predictions completely encrypted until market resolution.

### Problem Solved
Traditional on-chain prediction markets suffer from transparency paradoxes where all bets are visible, enabling front-running, market manipulation, and privacy loss. Our solution uses Arcium's encrypted compute to eliminate these issues while maintaining the benefits of blockchain transparency.

### Key Innovation
- **First privacy-preserving prediction market using MPC on Solana**
- Bet amounts and predictions stay encrypted throughout the market lifecycle
- Fair payout calculation without revealing individual positions
- Zero-trust architecture where no single party can see or manipulate data

- Privacy-seeking crypto users: Growing segment

### 4. Clarity ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
- README with architecture diagrams and code examples
- ARCHITECTURE.md with deep technical explanations
- Inline code comments explaining privacy guarantees
- Complete data flow diagrams

‚úÖ **Clear Privacy Explanation**
- What stays private (bet amounts, predictions)
- What gets revealed (aggregate totals, payout ratios)
- How MPC ensures no single node sees plaintext
- Security properties (confidentiality, integrity, fairness)

‚úÖ **Demo Application**
- Complete market lifecycle demonstration
- Step-by-step encryption flow
- Real-world use case (Bitcoin price prediction)
- Educational console output

## üîê Privacy Features Demonstrated

### What Stays Private
- ‚úÖ Individual bet amounts (encrypted with RescueCipher)
- ‚úÖ Prediction choices (YES/NO stays hidden)
- ‚úÖ User positions (no one knows who bet what)
- ‚úÖ Strategic information (no front-running possible)

### What Gets Revealed
- üìä Market outcome (after resolution)
- üìä Total pool size (aggregate of all bets)
- üìä Payout ratios (for winners to claim)
- üìä Winner status (who can claim, not amounts)

### Privacy Mechanisms
1. **Client-side Encryption**: x25519 ECDH + RescueCipher
2. **MPC Computation**: Secret-shared processing across Arx nodes
3. **Selective Revelation**: Only aggregate data revealed
4. **Zero Trust**: No central party can decrypt individual bets

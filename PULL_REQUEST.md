# 🔒 Dark Prediction Market - Arcium MPC Integration

## Summary

This PR introduces a complete privacy-preserving prediction market implementation leveraging **Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** network on Solana. All bet amounts and predictions remain encrypted throughout the market lifecycle, preventing front-running and manipulation while maintaining fair payouts.

## 🎯 What's New

### Core Features
- ✅ **Privacy-Preserving Prediction Markets** using Arcium encrypted compute
- ✅ **Encrypted Bet Placement** with x25519 ECDH + RescueCipher
- ✅ **MPC-Based Market Resolution** calculating payouts without revealing individual bets
- ✅ **Fair Randomness Generation** via distributed MPC computation
- ✅ **Zero-Trust Architecture** where no single party can see plaintext data

### Technical Implementation

**Encrypted Instructions** (`encrypted-ixs/`)
- `place_bet.rs` - Process bets in MPC without revealing amount/prediction
- `resolve_market.rs` - Calculate aggregated payouts on encrypted data
- `generate_randomness.rs` - Generate unpredictable random numbers

**Solana Program** (`programs/dark-prediction-market/`)
- Complete Anchor-based program with 6 instructions
- PDA-based state management (Market, Bet, Resolution)
- MPC computation queueing and callback handlers
- Comprehensive error handling

**Client Library** (`app/`)
- TypeScript encryption/decryption utilities
- Demo application showing complete market lifecycle
- Integration with Arcium SDK patterns

**Testing** (`tests/`)
- 20+ test cases covering all scenarios
- Privacy guarantees validation
- Full lifecycle integration tests

### Documentation
- 📖 **README.md** - Complete project overview with architecture diagrams
- 📖 **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Deep technical dive into MPC implementation
- 📖 **SUBMISSION.md** - Hackathon submission details
- 📖 **LICENSE** - MIT open source license

## 🔐 Privacy Guarantees

### What Stays Private
- Individual bet amounts (encrypted with RescueCipher)
- Prediction choices (YES/NO stays hidden)
- User positions (no visibility into who bet what)
- Strategic information (impossible to front-run)

### What Gets Revealed
- Market outcome (after resolution)
- Total pool size (aggregate across all bets)
- Payout ratios (for winners to claim)
- Winner status (who won, not individual amounts)

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Bet Placement Flow
```
User → Encrypt (x25519 + RescueCipher) → Solana Program 
     → Queue MPC Computation → Arx Nodes (Secret Shares)
     → MPC Execution → Callback → Store Encrypted Receipt
```

### 2. Market Resolution Flow
```
Creator → Trigger Resolution → Fetch All Encrypted Bets
       → MPC Aggregation (no plaintext exposure)
       → Calculate Payouts → Reveal Aggregates Only
       → Update Resolution State
```

### 3. Privacy Mechanism
```
Plaintext: 5 SOL bet on YES
     ↓ x25519 ECDH
Shared Secret: 0x4a3f...
     ↓ RescueCipher
Ciphertext: [32 bytes]
     ↓ Secret Sharing
Node 1: share_1, Node 2: share_2, Node 3: share_3
     ↓ MPC Operations
Encrypted Result (no node sees plaintext)
```

## üìù Submission Text

### Project Title
```
Dark Prediction Market - Privacy-First Predictions with Arcium MPC
```

### Tagline
```
Keep your bets private, markets fair. Built with Arcium's encrypted compute on Solana.
```

### Description (500 char limit)
```
Dark Prediction Market is the first privacy-preserving prediction market on Solana, powered by Arcium's Multi-Party Computation. Users can place bets with encrypted amounts and predictions, preventing front-running and market manipulation. Arcium's MPC network processes all sensitive data without ever seeing plaintext values, enabling fair market resolution while maintaining complete privacy. Built with Solana for speed, Arcium for privacy, and modern UX for accessibility.
```

### How Arcium is Used (Required)
```
Arcium Integration:

1. CLIENT-SIDE ENCRYPTION
   - Bet data encrypted using x25519 ECDH + RescueCipher
   - Shared secrets derived with MXE public key
   - Encrypted values submitted to blockchain

2. MPC INSTRUCTIONS
   - place_encrypted_bet(): Processes bets in distributed MPC network
   - resolve_encrypted_market(): Calculates payouts on encrypted data
   - generate_random(): Fair RNG via MPC

3. PRIVACY GUARANTEES
   - Individual bet amounts stay encrypted
   - Predictions hidden from all participants
   - Only aggregates revealed after resolution
   - No single Arx node sees plaintext

4. ARCHITECTURE
   - Enc<Shared, T> types for encrypted values
   - Secret sharing across Arx nodes
   - Byzantine fault tolerance
   - Zero-knowledge computation

See ARCIUM_INTEGRATION.md for detailed implementation.
```

### Privacy Benefits (Required)
```
Privacy Benefits:

‚úì PREVENTS FRONT-RUNNING
  No one can see your bet amount before placing theirs

‚úì ELIMINATES MANIPULATION
  Hidden predictions prevent copy-trading and influencing

‚úì PROTECTS USER PRIVACY
  Your positions and amounts remain confidential

‚úì ENABLES FAIR MARKETS
  Resolution calculated on encrypted data via MPC

‚úì ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE
  No single party (including us) can decrypt your bets

‚úì INSTITUTIONAL-GRADE PRIVACY
  Suitable for high-value, privacy-sensitive use cases

Result: Fair, transparent markets without the transparency paradox.
```
